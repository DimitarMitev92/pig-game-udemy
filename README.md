Description\
-----------

The Pig Game is a simple and entertaining dice rolling game. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a specific score, typically set to 100. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die and accumulating points. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose their current points and the turn passes to the next player. The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds the target score.

Features\
--------

The Pig Game offers the following features:

-   **Gameplay**: Players take turns rolling the dice and accumulating points.\
-   **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of each player's score, displaying it on the screen.\
-   **Current Score**: The game shows the current score for the active player during their turn.\
-   **Winning Condition**: The game automatically declares the winner when a player reaches or exceeds the target score.\
-   **New Game**: Players have the option to start a new game at any time, resetting the scores and starting from scratch.

Usage\
-----

Once the game is launched, you can start playing by clicking the "Roll Dice" button. The game will roll a six-sided die and display the result. If you roll a number other than 1, your current score will increase, and you can choose to either roll again or hold your current score. If you roll a 1, your current score will be reset, and the turn will pass to the next player.

The first player to reach or exceed the target score (typically 100) wins the game. You can start a new game at any time by clicking the "New Game" button, which will reset the scores and start from scratch.

Challenge your friends and family to see who can reach the target score first and become the Pig Game champion!
